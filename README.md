## Why the fork on 12 September 2022

The [original repo from trevorsandy](https://github.com/trevorsandy/blenderldrawrender) is abandoned
from 18 July 2020. This addons seems promising but it doesnt install on Blender 2.92+ (I'm using 3.2).
I want to try to use this addon to create Syntethic data for Machine Learning. It should have everything needed
but without a single HOW-TO, I need to "reverse engineer" the code and figure it out. Will write the How-to and
example Blender script once I understand how to actually do it.

## TODO:

-Guide on HOW-TO install  
-Working example on how to script Blender for actually use this addons.

## LPub3D Render LDraw Models with Blender

A [Blender](https://www.blender.org)&trade; add-on for importing and rendering [LDraw](http://www.ldraw.org)&trade; file format models and parts.

## Purpose

_LPub3D Import LDraw_ imports [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/)® models into Blender. This addon is intended to support direct Blender integration with [LPub3D](https://trevorsandy.github.io/lpub3d).

This addon was designed to provide [LPub3D](https://trevorsandy.github.io/lpub3d) an autonomous module enabling the integrated import and render of LDraw [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/)® models using [Blender](https://www.blender.org)&trade;. However, it can be executed directly from the Blender GUI, CLI or your operating system command console.

It supports **.mpd**, **.ldr**, and **.dat** file formats.

The LDraw import module is adapted from [Import LDraw](https://github.com/TobyLobster/ImportLDraw) by Toby Nelson (tobymnelson@gmail.com).

## Render Features

- Available for Blender 2.80 and later (2.79 backport in progress).
- **Mac**, **Windows** and **Linux** supported.
- **MPD** file compatible.
- **Render settings configurable** from LPub3D user interface.
- **Monitor render progress** from LPub3D user interface or launch Blender and directly invoke render routine from manu item.
- **Render Portable Network Graphics (.png)** image files.
- **Crop images** with transparent background to their opaque bounds
- **Specify transparent background** from render settings
- **Specify blendfile** to load additional settings
- **Specify exr 'environment' file** to load custom backdrop and ground plane

## Import Features

- Available for Blender 2.80 and later (2.79 backport in progress).
- **Mac**, **Windows** and **Linux** supported.
- **MPD** file compatible.
- **Import settings configurable** from LPub3D user interface.
- **LeoCAD** groups and cameras (both perspective and orthographic) supported.
- **LSynth** bendable parts supported (synthesized models).
- **LDCad** generated parts supported.
- **Additional LDraw parts paths** can be specified.
- **LGEO colours, sloped bricks and lighted bricks** can be custom configured via parameter (ini) file.
- **Import and apply camera settings** from LPub3D generated LDraw content
- **Import and apply light settings** from LPub3D generated LDraw content.
- **Pointlignt**, **Sunlight**, **Spotlight** and **Arealight** sources available.
- **LDraw archive (.zip) or disc library** supported. Archive libraries are auto detected when available at the specified LDraw directory path.
- _Cycles_ and _Blender Render_ engines supported. It renders either engine from a single scene.
- Import **Photorealistic** look, or **Instructions** look.
- **Physically Based Realistic materials** - standard brick material, transparent, rubber, chrome, metal, pearlescent, glow-in-the-dark, glitter and speckle.
- **Principled Shader supported** Uses Blender's 'Principled Shader' where available for optimal look (but still works well when unavailable).
- **Accurate colour handling**. Correct colour space management is used so that e.g. black parts look black.
- **Direct colours** supported.
- **Back face culling** - fully parses all BFC information, for accurate normals.
- **Linked duplicates** - Parts of the same type and colour can share the same mesh.
- **Linked studs** - studs can also share the same mesh.
- Studs can include the **LEGO logo** on them, adding extra geometry.
- **Gaps between bricks** - Optionally adds a small space between each brick, as in real life.
- **Smart face smoothing** - Uses Edge-Split Modifier and Sharp Edges derived from Ldraw lines, for smooth curved surfaces and sharp corners.
- **Concave walls** - Optionally look as if each brick has very slightly concave walls (with the photorealistic renderer), which affects the look of light reflections.
- **Light bricks** - Bricks that emit light are supported.
- **Fast** - even large models can be imported in seconds.
